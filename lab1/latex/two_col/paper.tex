                        % Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as
                        % IEEE does not allow \baselineskip to stretch.
                        % Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
                        % that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
                        % that authors should try to avoid such use.
                        % Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or
                        % midfloat.sty package (by the same author) as IEEE

                        % preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline
                        % equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
                        % after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks
                        % as IEEEtran.cls normally does. amsmath.sty is already
                        % installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version

                        % http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/



% Other popular packages for formatting tables and equations include:

\usepackage{float}
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty which improves the

% additional user controls. array.sty is already installed on most systems.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

% V1.6 of IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can
% be used to generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc.

% Also of notable interest:
% Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating (automatically sized) equal
% width boxes. Available:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/eqparbox/

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

% Each section begins with a \section{title} command
\section{Introduction}

	% \PARstart{}{} creates a tall first letter for this first paragraph
	\PARstart{T}{his} lab does not have an in-class portion. All you would need
	to reproduce the results is a computer with Python. I did all of my
	development in Vim. If you would like to emulate my environment, you can
	find my .vimrc on github at:

\begin{lstlisting}
jpribyl/legendary-waddle 
\end{lstlisting}

Additionally, you can find all of my code at:
\begin{lstlisting}
jpribyl/cautious-palm-tree
\end{lstlisting}

% Main Part
\section{Starting Python}

	% LaTeX takes complete care of your document layout ...
	I had a much easier time loading python than some of my peers. This is
	probably a result, at least in part, to this line in my .bashrc:

\begin{lstlisting}
alias accio='sudo apt-get install'
\end{lstlisting}

While they had to mess around with the PATH and environment variables, I got to
sail away into the sunset with:
\begin{lstlisting}
accio python && python
\end{lstlisting}

It also probably doesn't hurt that I have used Python before.

\section{Exercises: Python and Plotting}
\subsection{Numbers \& Arrays}
This section provides an extremely basic introduction to python. I think that
it's main purpose was to check whether my version of python supports implicit
conversion of integers to floats.

Although I occaisionally set up a virtual environment in python 2 by accident, I
prefer usin python 3. Among other things, it does support this implicit
conversion.

The code in this section was simple enough that I opted to do input it directly
to the terminal. Here are the results. The characters $>>>$ occur before inputs
but not before outputs.

\begin{lstlisting}
$ python3
Python 3.5.2 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
>>> 5.0/3
1.6666666666666667
>>> 5/3
1.6666666666666667
>>> 5**2
25
>>> import numpy as np
>>> np.sin(np.pi/6)
0.49999999999999994
>>> t=10
>>> t2=2*t
>>> g=-9.8
>>> y=g*t**2/2
>>> print(y)
-490.00000000000006
\end{lstlisting}

Had I tried using NumPy before importing it, I would have gotten an error:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> np.pi
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'np' is not defined
>>> 
\end{verbatim}

Which could be good to keep in mind going forward.
\subsection{Plotting Data and Curves}
This section is a slight step up from the previous section. Although I do love
jupyter, I'm not quite ready to let go of vim, so I got familiar with 

\begin{lstlisting}
		plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

The code for this section is detailed almost word for word in
$lab\_descrip/data\_analysis.pdf$ so I'm not going to recopy it here. You can
find it at $cautious-palm-tree/simple\_plot.py$. The plot is in Figure 1. 

If we alter the code a little bit, then we can easily include error bars, label axes, add a legend, change the
color, symbol, size, and line type. 

\begin{minipage}[t]{.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Altering the Graphs, frame=tlrb]{name}
# changing color, size, and symbol
plt.plot(
		t_theory,
	   	y_theory,
	   	'r.',
	   	MarkerSize=1
)

# labelling axes
plt.xlabel('time (s)')
plt.ylabel('height (m)')

# and, adding a legend
plt.legend(['Theory', 'Actual'])
plt.show()
plt.savefig('figures/figure3.png')

\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\begin{figure}[h]
		% Center the figure.
		\begin{center}
		% Include the eps file, scale it such that it's width equals the column width. You can also put width=8cm for example...
		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{/home/jp/kod/py/bin/venv/py3/phx444/data_analysis/figures/figure1.png}
		% Create a subtitle for the figure.
		\caption{Plot generated by a simple plot of kinematics}
		% Define the label of the figure. It's good to use 'fig:title', so you know that the label belongs to a figure.
		\label{fig:fig_1}
		\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
		% Center the figure.
		\begin{center}
		% Include the eps file, scale it such that it's width equals the column width. You can also put width=8cm for example...
		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{/home/jp/kod/py/bin/venv/py3/phx444/data_analysis/figures/figure2.png}
		% Create a subtitle for the figure.
		\caption{Including mock error bars}
		% Define the label of the figure. It's good to use 'fig:title', so you know that the label belongs to a figure.
		\label{fig:fig_2}
		\end{center}
\end{figure}


Which produces this plot:
\begin{figure}[t]
		% Center the figure.
		\begin{center}
		% Include the eps file, scale it such that it's width equals the column width. You can also put width=8cm for example...
		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{/home/jp/kod/py/bin/venv/py3/phx444/data_analysis/figures/figure3.png}
		% Create a subtitle for the figure.
		\caption{Changing size and introducing a legend}
		% Define the label of the figure. It's good to use 'fig:title', so you know that the label belongs to a figure.
		\label{fig:fig_3}
		\end{center}
\end{figure}



\section{Format}
	The report can be written in \LaTeX{} or Microsoft Word, but \LaTeX{} is definitely preferred.
	Its appearance should be as close to this document as possible to achieve consistency in the proceedings.

	% You can cite a book or paper by using \cite{reference}.
	% The references will be defined at the end of this .tex file in the bibliography
	References should be cited as numbers, and should be ordered by their appearance (example: ``... as shown in \cite{HOP96}, ...'').
	Only references that are actually cited can be listed in the references section.
	The references' format should be evident from the examples in this text.

	References should be of academic character and should be published and accessible.
	Your advisor can answer your questions regarding literature research.
	You must cite all used sources.
	Examples of good references include text books and scientific journals or conference proceedings.
	If possible, citing internet pages should be avoided. In particular, Wikipedia is \emph{not} an appropriate reference in academic reports.
	Avoiding references in languages other than English is recommended.

	% You can reference tables and figure by using the \ref{label} command. Each table and figure needs to have a UNIQUE label.
	%Figures and tables should be labeled and numbered, such as in Table~\ref{tab:simParameters} and Fig.~\ref{fig:tf_plot}.

	% This is how you define a table: the [!hbt] means that LaTeX is forced (by the !) to place the table exactly here (by h), or if that doesnt work because of a pagebreak or so, it tries to place the table to the bottom of the page (by b) or the top (by t).
	\begin{table}[!hbt]
		% Center the table
		\begin{center}
		% Title of the table
		\caption{Simulation Parameters}
		\label{tab:simParameters}
		% Table itself: here we have two columns which are centered and have lines to the left, right and in the middle: |c|c|
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
			% To create a horizontal line, type \hline
			\hline
			% To end a column type &
			% For a linebreak type \\
			Information message length & $k=16000$ bit \\
			\hline
			Radio segment size & $b=160$ bit \\
			\hline
			Rate of component codes & $R_{cc}=1/3$\\
			\hline
			Polynomial of component encoders & $[1 , 33/37 , 25/37]_8$\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
	\end{table}

	% If you have questions about how to write mathematical formulas in LaTeX, please read a LaTeX book or the 'Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX': tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf

	% This is how you include a eps figure in your document. LaTeX only accepts EPS or TIFF files.

\section{Filling this page}
	Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres, quarum unam incolunt Belgae, aliam Aquitani, tertiam qui ipsorum lingua Celtae, nostra Galli appellantur. Gallos ab Aquitanis Garumna flumen, a Belgis Matrona et Sequana dividit. Horum omnium fortissimi sunt Belgae, propterea quod a cultu atque humanitate provinciae longissime absunt, minimeque ad eos mercatores saepe commeant atque ea quae ad effeminandos animos pertinent important, proximique sunt Germanis, qui trans Rhenum incolunt, quibuscum continenter bellum gerunt. Qua de causa Helvetii quoque reliquos Gallos virtute praecedunt, quod fere cotidianis proeliis cum Germanis contendunt, cum aut suis finibus eos prohibent aut ipsi in eorum finibus bellum gerunt. Eorum una, pars, quam Gallos obtinere dictum est, initium capit a flumine Rhodano, continetur Garumna flumine, Oceano, finibus Belgarum, attingit etiam ab Sequanis et Helvetiis flumen Rhenum, vergit ad septentriones. Belgae ab extremis Galliae finibus oriuntur, pertinent ad inferiorem partem fluminis Rheni, spectant in septentrionem et orientem solem.
